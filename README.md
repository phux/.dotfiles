## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to transform your development environment? Follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/phux/.dotfiles.git
    cd .dotfiles
    ```

2.  **Install Ansible and dependencies:**

    ```bash
    make
    ```

    This command will install Ansible and any other necessary dependencies to run the playbooks on your system.

3.  **Install on localhost (use with caution!):**

    This step will apply all the configurations directly to your current machine. **Please be aware that this process will overwrite your existing configuration files, and no automatic backup is made. It's highly recommended to back up your current dotfiles before proceeding.**

    ```bash
    make provision
    ```

## üîß Customization

These dotfiles are designed to be flexible! Feel free to tailor them to your unique preferences:

- **Variables:** Adjust global settings by modifying the variables in `group_vars/all/vars.yml`.
- **Roles:** Dive into the `roles/` directory to understand how each application is configured. You can easily enable, disable, or modify specific tasks within these roles to suit your needs.

## ü§ù Contributing
