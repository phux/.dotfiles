## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to transform your development environment? Follow these simple steps:

### Requirements

- **Ansible**: This project relies on Ansible for provisioning. Ensure you have it installed on your system.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/phux/.dotfiles.git
  cd .dotfiles
  ```

2. **Install Ansible and dependencies:**

  ```bash
  make
  ```

  This command will install Ansible and any other necessary Python dependencies required to run the playbooks on your system.

3. **Install on localhost (use with caution!):**

  This step will apply all the configurations directly to your current machine. **Please be aware that this process will overwrite your existing configuration files, and no automatic backup is made. It's highly recommended to back up your current dotfiles before proceeding.**

  ```bash
  make provision
  ```

## 🔧 Customization

These dotfiles are designed to be flexible! Feel free to tailor them to your unique preferences:

- **Variables:** Adjust global settings by modifying the variables in `group_vars/all/vars.yml`.
- **Roles:** Dive into the `roles/` directory to understand how each application is configured. You can easily enable, disable, or modify specific tasks within these roles to suit your needs.

## 📂 Project Structure

This repository follows a standard Ansible project structure:

- **`playbook.yml`**: The main Ansible playbook that orchestrates the execution of roles.
- **`roles/`**: Contains individual Ansible roles, each responsible for configuring a specific tool or aspect of the system.
- **`group_vars/`**: Stores variables that apply to groups of hosts. `group_vars/all/vars.yml` contains global variables.
- **`hosts`**: The Ansible inventory file, defining the hosts to be managed.
- **`Makefile`**: Provides convenient shortcuts for common tasks like installing dependencies and running the playbook.
